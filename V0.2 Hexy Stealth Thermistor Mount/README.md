# Installation Notes:
:warning: This mod requires a threaded end hole for one of the Z extrusions.  
:warning: This mod requires a new backplate with a hole for passing the wires. (Printer specific, there are tons of mods online)

- You could use the other side by using the mirror command to the body in slicer.
- The fit is supposed to be tight. If it is too tight, you can ream the hole using a Ã˜3mm drill bit.
- Pre-supported CAD, no need additional supports.  
- If the pre-supported print doesn't work due to tolerances, use the regular STL and print as you desired.
