#### 1.2.2) Remove supports:

#### 1.3) Depin the USB camera connector and (strip the thick insulation)
:warning: Remember the order of wires! Take a photo or something.  
:warning: Be careful of depining, the terminals are small and delicate.  
:warning: You will only strip the main insulation if it is too thick and cannot be inserted inside the 1515 extrusion.  
- My USB cable came with a thick outer insulation and shielding so stripping was necessary.
