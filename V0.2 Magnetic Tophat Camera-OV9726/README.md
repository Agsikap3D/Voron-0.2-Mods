# Voron 0.2 Magnetic Tophat Camera-OV9726

A magnetic tophat camera mod that provides the user flexibility to remove the tophat for printing PLA.  
The design also considers the possibility of installing dual aux fans.

## Things to consider before you proceed:
⚠️ This is a niche mod. ⚠️  
- Created because of the circumstances and because I can. Plus I have a spare OV9726 camera module.
- The camera view is not perfect, toolhead is blocking the actual print while printing. But this is enough for me.

✔️ To fully utilize this mod, it is necessary to have a removable tophat mod by Chirpy or it's derivatives:

✔️ The mod can be used on an enclosed and fully open (No tophat and door) configuration.
